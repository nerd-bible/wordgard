/// This module defines the library's document data structure, change
/// model, and some helper functionality for working with those.
///
/// ### Document
///
/// A document is a tree of nodes. It is made up of these elements:
///
/// - {@link Node Nodes} can be {@link Plot plots} (nodes with content
///   nodes) or {@link Leaf leaves}. The top document node is a plot.
///
/// - Each node has a {@link Node.Type type}.
///
/// - {@link Mark Marks} are pieces of information attached to nodes.
///   They are used for things like text style, image alt text, or
///   block alignment.
///
/// - {@link Node.Tag Tags} describes a node's nature, it combines a
///   {@link Node.Type node type}, an optional parameter value, and a
///   set of marks. Leaf nodes {@link Leaf _are_} tags, plot nodes
///   {@link Plot.tag _have_} tags.

export {Node, Leaf, Plot} from "./node"
export {Mark} from "./mark"

/// ### Shapes
///
/// Node and mark shapes (the way they are converted to and from
/// DOM/HTML structure) can be defined with these data structures.

export {Shape, Elt, Attributes} from "./shape"

/// ### Schema
///
/// Each document has a {@link Schema schema} associated with it that
/// configures the set of nodes and marks that can occur in it, and
/// their relations.

export {Schema} from "./schema"
export {SchemaError, ValidationError} from "./error"

/// ### Changes
///
/// Document changes are represented as a series of replaced or
/// updated (adding or removing marks) ranges.

export {ChangeSet} from "./change"
export {Slice, Token} from "./slice"

/// ### Resolved Positions
///
/// Positions in a wordgard document are expressed with offset numbers.
/// On its own, such a number doesn't tell you much about its context.
/// Resolved positions are data structures that describe a node or a
/// position in a node, plus that node's parents (if any).

export {Pos} from "./pos"

/// ### Parsing and Serialization
///
/// These functions allow conversion between HTML and Wordgard
/// document formats. Note that, because not all of HTML is
/// expressible in a given Wordgard schema, parsing is lossy.

export {parse} from "./parse"
export {serialize} from "./serialize"
