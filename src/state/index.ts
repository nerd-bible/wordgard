//- This module defines an {@link GardState editor state} data
//- structure, a {@link Transaction transaction} abstraction for
//- updating such a state, and a {@link GardSelection selection
//- model}.

//- ### Editor State

//- The editor state captures the situation in a Wordgard editor at
//- any given point in time. The editor starts with a given state when
//- created. On every state-affecting user action, it applies a {@link
//- Transaction transaction}, which produces the new editor state.

export {GardState} from "./state"
export {Transaction} from "./transaction"

//- ### Selection

//- Editor selections are objects that derive from {@link
//- GardSelection}. This module defines {@link GardSelection.Text
//- text} and {@link GardSelection.Node node} selection types. It is
//- possible for extension code to {@link GardSelection.define define}
//- custom selection types.

export {GardSelection} from "./selection"

//- ### Textblocks

//- It is often helpful to look at a textblock (a block plot
//- containing inline content) as a flat line of text. A {@link
//- TextblockMap textblock map} is a data structure intended to make
//- that easy.

export {TextblockMap} from "./textblock"
export {BidiSpan} from "./bidi"

//- ### Corrections

//- Corrections provide an abstraction for enforcing certain types of
//- invariants about a document's shape. They watch for some kinds of
//- document changes on specific types of nodes and, when they occur,
//- run a function to verify that some condition holds and optionally
//- adjust the content by making more changes.

//- The correcting function will be passed a {@link Pos.Node} object
//- pointing at the matched node, as well as the editor state _before_
//- the transaction. Changes it produces will be interpreted as
//- relative to the document _after_ the transaction (so `node.doc`).

//- Corrections are wrappers around {@link Transaction.extender
//- transaction extenders}. This means that their effect will be
//- included in transactions as they are applied.

export {Correction} from "./correction"
